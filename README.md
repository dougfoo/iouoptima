# iou optima

My mini project to build the ultimate IOU application

 - Technology
    - React front end with antd component library
    - Django and REST on backend
    - Integration to Mongo backend
    - Login integration to Google / FB
    - Hosted integration w/ Azure AWS and GCE

 - User management
    - basic login/registration
    - friends list management
    - password management

 - IOU management
    - user has an IOU pointed to a user
    - (or split between users)
    - IOU needs to be confirmed by other party to be LIVE
    - (States:  Pending, Live, Paid)

 - Tri-party optimization / collapse
